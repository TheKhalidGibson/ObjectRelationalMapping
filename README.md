# E-Commerce BackEnd : (ORM) Object-Relational Mapping

## My Task

The electronics industry has been steam rolling through businesses and consumers in many ways. One of the more impactful ways would certainly have to be **e-commerce**, also known as Internet retail. Online buying and selling, the business that has been estimated to have brought in a grand total of about $2.54 trillion in US currency, is without a doubt a booming industry. This stat has been sourced from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which should say a lot. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide convenient services to businesses of all sizes and this is due to the well planned out and efficiently executed architecture of their platforms.

My task was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I have used Sequelize by configuring a working Express.js API to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application is a back end technology it will not be deployed for this portion of development. With that being said I have recorded a walkthrough video in order to demonstrate the functionality of this creation.
